EchoTuner is an open-source, AI-powered playlist generation platform designed for music enthusiasts who want complete control over their Spotify experience. Built with the "run it yourself" philosophy, EchoTuner leverages Spotify's Web API to create personalized playlists based on audio features like energy, valence, danceability, and more.

**Key Features:**
- **Local-First Approach**: Deploy EchoTuner with your own Spotify Developer credentials - no rate limits, complete privacy, total control
- **Audio Feature Analysis**: Generate playlists based on sophisticated audio characteristics rather than just genres
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with a clean separation between frontend and backend, featuring real-time playlist syncing
- **Docker Ready**: Complete containerized deployment with comprehensive documentation
- **Developer-Friendly**: Extensive API documentation and modular design for easy customization

What sets EchoTuner apart is its response to Spotify's restrictive API quotas. Instead of fighting the system, it embraces local deployment, giving developers and music lovers a powerful tool they own completely. The project demonstrates how to build personal-scale software that doesn't rely on external services that might disappear or change terms.

EchoTuner isn't just a music app - it's a template for building tools that you control entirely, encouraging developers to create their own small-scale applications rather than depending on centralized services.
