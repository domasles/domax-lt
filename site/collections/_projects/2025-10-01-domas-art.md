My art project seems simple from the looks of it - an empty room with a few paintings on the walls. The fascinating part about it is its technology, and browser evolution over the last decade.

With the introduction of WebGL, WASM and other modern web technologies, creating immersive experiences in the browser (through the form of games, most often) has become a reality. A very easily accessible reality, actually.

What you're seeing on [My Art Project](https://art.domax.lt) is a Unity-built game. Simple, but a very powerful one from the tech standpoint! Where quality hardly differs from native applications, and the only requirement is a modern browser.

**The beauty of it:**

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser - Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- **No Installations**: No need to download or install anything - just open the link
- **High Performance**: Leveraging WebGL and WASM for near-native performance
- **Easy Updates**: Instant updates without requiring users to download patches or new versions

Sadly, the game hasn't been open sourced yet, but I plan to do so in the near future.

However, there's nobody stopping you from supporting WebGL too - building your own web games and communities with such amounts of content has never been this easy.

What also separates WebGL and WASM apart from other applications is their flexibility - everything is loaded through HTML and JS files you can tweak easily for your needs before hosting, the only non-moddable part is the WASM executable, providing significant leaps in web content obfuscation.

Due to this charming origin of WASM games, I have also made [Crimson](/project/crimson) support it, so you can leverage easy game development process that does not require a lot of space, neither many resources to test (unlike some commercial engines).

So what are you waiting for? Hop onto this train and let the WASM's ball roll, reaching the best of heights!
