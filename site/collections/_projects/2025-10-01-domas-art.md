My art project seems simple from the looks of it: an empty room with a few paintings on the walls. The fascinating part about it is its technology, and how have browsers evolved over the last decade.

With the introduction of WebGL, WASM and other modern web technologies, creating immersive 3D experiences in the browser has become a reality. A very easily available reality, actually.

What you're seeing on [My Art Project](https://art.domax.lt) is a Unity-built game. Simple approach, but a very powerful one! Where quality hardly differs from native applications, and the only requirement is a modern browser.

**The beauty of it:**

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser - Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- **No Installations**: No need to download or install anything - just open the link
- **High Performance**: Leveraging WebGL and WASM for near-native performance
- **Easy Updates**: Instant updates without requiring users to download patches or new versions

There's nobody stopping you from also supporting WebGL and building your own web games! Building communities with easily accessible content has never been this easy.

What also separates WebGL and WASM apart fron other approaches is their flexibility - everything is loaded through an HTML file you can tweak easily for your needs before hosting, the only non-moddable part is the WASM executable, providing significant leaps in web content obfuscation.

Due to this charming origin of WASM games, I have also implemented WASM support into [Crimson](/projects/crimson), so you can leverage easy game development process that does not require a lot of space, neither many resources to test (unlike some commercial engines).

So what are you waiting for? Hop onto this train and let the WASM ball roll, reaching best of heights!
