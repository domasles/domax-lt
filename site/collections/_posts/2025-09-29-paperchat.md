[PaperChat](https://github.com/domasles/paperchat) represents a new approach to integrating AI into gaming: a Minecraft plugin that brings powerful language models directly into the game world while maintaining complete privacy and user control.

In an era where AI integration often means sending your data to unknown servers, PaperChat takes a different path by requiring your own API credentials and keeping everything under your control.

## The Vision: AI Without Compromise

Most AI-powered applications today require you to trust external services with your data. PaperChat follows the "run it yourself" philosophy, ensuring that:

- **No Rate Limits**: Your API keys, your usage quotas
- **Complete Privacy**: Player conversations never leave your infrastructure  
- **Full Control**: Customize AI behavior, system prompts, and response filtering
- **No Dependencies**: No external services beyond the AI providers themselves

This approach transforms how we think about AI integration - instead of building services that scale to millions, we create tools that work perfectly for communities of any size.

## Architecture and Design

### Clean Architecture Principles
PaperChat is built with modern software architecture principles:

```
src/main/java/lt/domax/paperchat/
├── domain/
│   ├── ai/            # AI provider abstractions and registry
│   ├── chat/          # Chat services and session management
│   ├── config/        # Configuration management
│   └── player/        # Player data management
├── infrastructure/
│   └── commands/      # Minecraft command implementations
```

This separation ensures that business logic remains independent of Minecraft-specific implementations, making the codebase maintainable and testable.

### Multi-Provider AI System

One of PaperChat's key strengths is its extensible AI provider system. The plugin currently supports:

#### Google Gemini

```java
@AIProvider("google")
public class GoogleProvider extends Provider {
    // Gemini API integration with advanced conversation handling
}
```

#### OpenAI

```java
@AIProvider("openai") 
public class OpenAIProvider extends Provider {
    // GPT model integration with customizable parameters
}
```

#### Hack Club AI

```java
@AIProvider("hackclub")
public class HackClubProvider extends Provider {
    // Free AI access with multiple model support
}
```

### Service Provider Interface (SPI)

The plugin uses Java's SPI pattern for automatic provider registration:

```
META-INF/services/lt.domax.paperchat.domain.ai.Provider
```

This design makes adding new AI providers as simple as implementing the abstract `Provider` class and registering it in the services file.

## Player Experience

### Natural Conversation Flow

Players interact with AI through simple commands:
```
/paperchat How can I build a better castle?
/paperchat What's the best way to organize my inventory?
/paperchat history
/paperchat clear
```

The plugin maintains conversation context per player, enabling meaningful multi-turn conversations that remember previous exchanges.

### Persistent Session Management

Each player has their own conversation history that persists across sessions:

- Configurable history limits to control memory usage
- Context-aware responses that reference previous conversations
- Privacy-focused design where each player's data remains isolated

## Configuration and Customization

### Flexible Configuration

PaperChat supports configuration through both environment variables and YAML files:

```yaml
ai:
  api-key: "your-api-key"
  provider: "google"
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  temperature: 0.7
  timeout: 30
  max-output-tokens: 4096
  system-prompt: "Custom system prompt here"

chat:
  max-history: 5
  max-input-characters: 100
```

### Advanced System Prompts

Server administrators can customize AI behavior through system prompts:

- Define the AI's personality and response style
- Set context about the Minecraft server and its community
- Establish guidelines for appropriate responses
- Create themed experiences (medieval server, sci-fi world, etc.)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Processing

All AI requests are handled asynchronously to maintain server performance:

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    return aiProvider.generateResponse(message, conversationHistory);
}).thenAccept(response -> {
    player.sendMessage(formatResponse(response));
}).exceptionally(throwable -> {
    handleError(player, throwable);
    return null;
});
```

This ensures that AI processing never blocks the main server thread, maintaining smooth gameplay for all players.

### Error Handling and Recovery

PaperChat includes comprehensive error handling:

- User-friendly error messages that don't expose technical details
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Detailed logging for administrators

### Security Considerations

The plugin implements several security measures:

- API keys are never logged or exposed to players
- All AI requests use HTTPS encryption
- Player data is stored locally only
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Character limits prevent abuse

## Deployment Options

### Docker Integration

PaperChat ships with complete Docker support:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  minecraft:
    image: papermc/paper:latest
    environment:
      - PAPERCHAT_API_KEY=your-key
      - PAPERCHAT_PROVIDER=google
      - PAPERCHAT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
    volumes:
      - ./plugins:/plugins
      - ./world:/world
```

This makes deployment straightforward and ensures consistent environments across different servers.

### Local Development

For developers wanting to extend or modify PaperChat:

```bash
# Build from source
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 9.0
./gradlew clean build

# Install on your test server
cp build/libs/paperchat-*.jar /path/to/server/plugins/
```

The project includes comprehensive development documentation and follows modern Java best practices.

## Community and Extensibility

### Adding New Providers

The plugin's architecture makes adding new AI providers straightforward:

1. Implement the abstract `Provider` class
2. Add the `@AIProvider` annotation with your provider name
3. Register the provider in the services file
4. Handle provider-specific configuration and API calls

This design has already enabled community contributions for additional AI services.

### Plugin Integration

PaperChat is designed to work well with other plugins:

- Respects existing permission systems
- Integrates with chat formatting plugins
- Supports multiple worlds and server networks
- Provides API for other plugins to integrate AI capabilities

## Real-World Usage

### Educational Servers

Many educational Minecraft servers use PaperChat to:

- Provide students with AI tutoring assistance
- Create immersive storytelling experiences
- Offer coding help and explanations
- Support language learning through conversation

### Community Building

Gaming communities leverage PaperChat for:

- Enhanced roleplay experiences with AI NPCs
- Creative writing assistance and collaboration
- Technical support and server guidance
- Community management and moderation assistance

## Performance and Scalability

### Resource Management

PaperChat is designed for efficiency:

- Minimal memory footprint with configurable history limits
- Asynchronous processing prevents server lag
- Intelligent caching reduces redundant API calls
- Graceful handling of rate limits and quotas

### Monitoring and Analytics

Server administrators can monitor:

- AI usage patterns and popular queries
- API quota consumption and costs
- Response times and error rates
- Player engagement metrics

## The Broader Impact

PaperChat demonstrates several important principles for modern software development:

### Privacy by Design

By requiring self-hosted deployment, the plugin ensures that player data never leaves the server operator's control. This approach could serve as a model for other AI integrations in gaming.

### Community Ownership

Rather than building a centralized service, PaperChat empowers communities to run their own AI integrations. This creates resilience and prevents vendor lock-in.

### Transparent Technology

The open-source nature allows communities to understand exactly how their AI integration works, fostering trust and enabling customization.

## Future Development

The roadmap for PaperChat includes:

- **Enhanced Provider Support**: Integration with more AI services and local models
- **Better Integration**: Deeper Minecraft integration with world awareness (building an agentic app)
- **Community Tools**: Web interface for configuration and monitoring
