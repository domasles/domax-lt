        Hello! My name is Domas and I'm an enthusiast full-stack developer, based in Lithuania.
        I love building web applications and learning new technologies. My main focus is on Python (And a grasp of Java), but I also enjoy working with Dart as a front-end language.
        When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, folding origami, riding bikes with friends or family, or experimenting with new ideas in maths and physics fields.
        What I'm learning currently is AI technologies, especially in the context of agentic applications. Perfect example of this is one of my projects - <a href="echotuner.domax.lt">EchoTuner</a>, which is an AI-powered Spotify playlist creation app.
      </p>

      <blockquote><p>
        The longer I live, the more I realize the capability and advantages of constant learning.
        I'm not afraid to make mistakes, but I'm always striving to improve and reach perfectionism.
        I believe that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible.
        Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or just chat about tech!

        My projects vary from technology to technology. All my projects I try to keep open source, so feel free to check them out on my <a href="https://github.com/domasles">GitHub</a>!
        Every one of them is a new adventure, often leading to roadblocks. My answer to them? No stopping!
        I always try to find a solution, and if I can't, I reach out to the community for help.
        Every project for me is an opportunity to learn, especially when world's tech stack is moving forwards so quickly. I'm afraid of being left behind!
        But the work I'm putting in, as it seems, always pays off.
      </p>

      <blockquote><p>
        My achievements vary, but most of them are in the IT field.
        I have participated in various summer activities, one of which was <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club's</a> Summer of Making 2025. It has sparked a huge flame in me!
        I have also won a couple of national contests, including IT Egzaminas a couple years back.
        Currently, I'm a 10th grader, studying in and out of school, participating in various initiatives, and trying to make the most out of my high school years.
