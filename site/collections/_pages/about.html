        Hello! My name is Domas and I'm an enthusiast full-stack developer, based in Lithuania.<br>
        I love building web applications and learning new technologies. My main focus is on Python (And a grasp of Java), but I also enjoy working with Dart as a front-end language.<br>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, folding origami, riding bikes with friends or family, or experimenting with new ideas in maths and physics fields.<br>
        What I'm learning currently is AI technologies, especially in the context of agentic applications. Perfect example of this is one of my projects - <a href="https://echotuner.domax.lt">EchoTuner</a>, which is an AI-powered Spotify playlist creation app.
      </p>

      <blockquote><p>
        The longer I live, the more I realize the capability and advantages of constant learning.<br>
        I'm not afraid to make mistakes, but I'm always striving to improve and reach perfectionism.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>
        I believe that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible.
        Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or just chat about tech!
      </p>

      <p>
        My projects vary from technology to technology. All my projects I try to keep open source, so feel free to check them out on my <a href="https://github.com/domasles">GitHub</a>!<br>
        Every one of them is a new adventure, often leading to roadblocks.<br>
        My answer to them? No stopping!<br>
        I always try to find a solution, and if I can't, I reach out to the community for help.<br>
        Every project for me is an opportunity to learn, especially when world's tech stack is moving forwards so quickly. I'm afraid of being left behind!<br>
        But the work I'm putting in, as it seems, always pays off.
      </p>

      <blockquote><p>
        My achievements vary, but most of them are in the IT field.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>
        I have participated in various summer activities, one of which was <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club's</a> Summer of Making 2025. It has sparked a huge flame in me!<br>
        I have also won a couple of national contests, including IT Egzaminas a couple years back.<br>
        Currently, I'm a 10th grader, studying in and out of school, participating in various initiatives, and trying to make the most out of my high school years.<br>
